=====================|   CUSTOMIZATION - REBUILDING  |===================


Some of the bar shaped skins can be modified in their appearance. They are build from 3 blocks:


left side - background - right side


The left side and right side graphics are triangles which can be changed or removed by commenting
(putting the ';' sign) their meters before the 'Meter=Image' strings.


Example from the 'Disk 1 Left' skin:

 
[RightSide4]
Meter=Image
ImageName=#@#Images/4.png
X=125
Y=0
W=50
H=50
AntiAlias=1


[RightSide2]
;Meter=Image
ImageName=#@#Images/2.png
X=125
Y=0
W=50
H=50
AntiAlias=1


By default the RightSide4 meter is visible and RightSide2 is hidden, resulting in displaying
the 4.png graphics. To change it to 2.png, comment the RightSide4 and uncomment the RightSide2.
To hide both of them (e.g. in order to put the skin on the side of the desktop), comment both
meters. This method applies to all skins utilizing these graphics.
